# 🔄 Unit Converter  

### Convert Length, Volume, and Mass with Ease!  

---

## 📌 Overview  
The **Unit Converter** project was built as part of Scrimba’s *Frontend Developer Career Course* under the **Making Websites Interactive** module. This was a **solo project**, designed to reinforce my understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while also improving my ability to implement UI designs using **Figma**.  

The project was initially developed using **Scrimba’s built-in Scrim editor** and later uploaded to **GitHub** for version control and portfolio purposes.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
- **Revisiting HTML, CSS & JavaScript**: Strengthening fundamental web development concepts.  
- **Practicing Figma-Based UI Design**: Replicating the **Figma mockup design** as accurately as possible.  
- **Implementing Interactive Features with JavaScript**: Handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the UI dynamically.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structuring the layout.  
- **CSS** – Styling the UI for a clean and modern look.  
- **JavaScript** – Handling user input and performing unit conversions.  
- **Figma** – Used as a design reference for precise UI implementation.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **User Input** – Enter a number to convert units.  
✅ **Dynamic Conversions** – Convert **length, volume, and mass** instantly.  
✅ **JavaScript Event Handling** – Uses `addEventListener` to trigger calculations.  
✅ **Figma-Based UI** – Designed based on a Figma mockup for a polished look.  

---

## 📌 How It Works  
1. The user **enters a number** into the input field.  
2. When the **"Convert" button** is clicked, JavaScript functions calculate and display:  
   - **Length conversion** (meters ↔ feet)  
   - **Volume conversion** (liters ↔ gallons)  
   - **Mass conversion** (kilograms ↔ pounds)  
3. The results are dynamically updated on the page.  

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements  
🔹 **Validate user input** to ensure only numbers are accepted.  
🔹 **Add more unit conversions** for enhanced functionality.  
🔹 **Improve UI/UX** for better user interaction.
